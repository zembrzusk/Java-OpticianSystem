Optician Office Project:
   An application in Java (also frontend) for small optician offices. The app supports opticians as well as other employees - salespeople or doctors during the process - starting from creating a prescription, order and glasses up to collection by the client. The system was created for the 6th semester class of Modeling Computer Systems. It includes all sorts of examples of classes, attributes, associations, inheritance and constraints.
